# Pokemon Wiki (by Region)

This repository contains my code for a frontend Pokemon wiki website that uses data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). This website is made using Vue 3. Click [here](https://pokedex-wiki.vercel.app/) to visit the deployed website.

## Note about website

- Some of the data being fetched are large, thus it may take 1-2 minutes to load the webpage. This is especially so for regions like paldea that has many pokemons

- Some pokemon's information may be missing/inaccurate. This is due to missing/inaccurate information from PokeAPI.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
